### Note:
> First, We could come up with a brute force algorithm to solve it quickly
> However, after running the code we find it runs badly,it may cost exp time complexity,so we need to optimize it
> So,how to optimize it?
> we took so much time to enumerate the useless number,so can we just improve the enumerate efficient?
> So a better solusion comes up we could just enumerate the sum of the digit and enumerate the power of it and check the answer
> To get a well perform of the speed we first let s to be large and power small and get a large enough sup
> and then we just add a optimize to speed up the enumerate
