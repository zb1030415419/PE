### Note
> The file '86.py' give an direct solusion by enumerate all situation and it runs well.<br>
> Here's a simple proof for a loose sup of the enumerate time:<br>
> because of the primitive Pythagoras triple(PPT) we know all odd number larger than 1 could have at least one PPT<br>
> and for any odd number larger than 2,we could rewrite n=t*(2k+1) and thus,there is at least one t times PPT for n<br>
> Therefore, for any integer larger than 2,there is at least one PT,so the sup could be 1e6+2
